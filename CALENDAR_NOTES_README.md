3. **Fill in the note details:**
   - Title (required)

The feature uses a new `calendar_notes` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE calendar_notes (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    note_date DATE NOT NULL,
    note_type TEXT DEFAULT 'note',

    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    tags TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

```
